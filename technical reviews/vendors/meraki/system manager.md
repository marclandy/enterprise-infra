## Overview

Deploying **Meraki Systems Manager (MSM)** at enterprise scale demands a structured, policy-driven design approach. With devices spanning corporate-owned, BYOD, and hybrid models, decisions must be made across multiple layers‚Äîidentity, enrollment, network access, app management, and compliance.

This blog post details critical **design decision areas**, summarizes the choices in a **quick-reference table**, and introduces **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for lifecycle management of devices using Meraki.

## üß∞ Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) ‚Äì Device Lifecycle Management

The following SOPs define the **end-to-end lifecycle** of devices managed by Meraki Systems Manager, from procurement to retirement.

### 1. Device Enrollment

- Leverage automated enrollment via ABM, Zero-Touch, or Windows Autopilot.
- Devices must be tagged by:
  - Ownership (BYOD, COPE, Corp)
  - Business Unit
  - Region
- Devices must check in and receive baseline profiles within 5 minutes.

### 2. Compliance & Policy Enforcement

- Enforce passcode, encryption, jailbreak/root detection.
- Apply role-based access and location-aware restrictions.
- Compliance checks run every 15 minutes.

### 3. App Deployment & Patch Management

- All core business apps distributed through VPP/Play Store.
- Auto-update schedule configured weekly (e.g., Sunday midnight).
- App blacklists must be enforced on non-compliant devices.

### 4. Network Access Control

- Device posture evaluated via Sentry before Wi-Fi access.
- RADIUS integration enforces dynamic VLAN and device certificates.

### 5. Monitoring, Logging & Reporting

- Send logs to centralized SIEM (e.g., Splunk) via Syslog.
- Non-compliant devices generate daily digest reports.
- Security incidents escalate via integration with ServiceNow.

### 6. Offboarding & Retirement

- De-provisioning triggers remote wipe or enterprise reset.
- Admins must remove licenses and archive logs for 90 days.
- Retired device records deleted after compliance retention period.

## üöÄ Infrastructure Teams : Maturity Model for Mobile Device Management

Once SOPs and these deliverables are defined, the team can start evolving towards:

| Maturity Level      | Characteristics                                                             |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standardized**     | SOPs and Runbooks followed consistently across teams                        |
| **Automated**        | API workflows triggered based on lifecycle state changes                    |
| **Integrated**       | Systems Manager connected with HR systems, ticketing, and IAM                |
| **Self-Healing**     | Compliance failures trigger auto-remediation (e.g., network isolation)       |
| **Optimized**        | Data from dashboard analytics used for proactive support and license tuning |

## üìò Summary

Meraki Systems Manager, when paired with enterprise-level governance, offers a unified approach to endpoint control, compliance, and automation. The design decisions and SOPs shared above support:

- Secure onboarding and Zero Trust access
- Lifecycle automation using APIs and native tools
- Segmentation and delegated administration at scale

## üñ±Ô∏è Infrastructure Teams governance of SOPs

</summary>
<br>

### 1. Day-to-Day Operations
- **Provisioning & Enrollment:** Technicians follow the SOP to onboard new devices consistently using ABM, Autopilot, or Zero-Touch.
- **Security Enforcement:** Policies for encryption, password enforcement, and jailbreak detection are validated during audits or reviews.
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Regular checks against SOP-defined posture evaluation (e.g., every 15 minutes) ensure devices remain compliant.

### 2. Onboarding & Training
- SOPs serve as a **training tool** for new engineers and service desk staff to standardize support processes.

### 3. Audit & Governance
- During compliance audits (ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2), the SOP is submitted as evidence of a defined lifecycle management process.

### 4. Automation Integration
- Infrastructure automation (Ansible, Terraform, ServiceNow workflows) is often built to mirror or extend SOP steps for device states (e.g., onboarding triggers app install jobs).

## üñ±Ô∏è Beyond the SOP

</summary>
<br>

- Infrastructure Teams approach to taking a static SOP to an adaptive, automated, and scalable architecture:

### 1. Runbooks
- Task-focused instructions derived from SOPs (e.g., *‚ÄúHow to offboard a compromised device‚Äù*).
- Includes screenshots or API/CLI instructions.

### 2. Reference Architecture
- Diagrammatic and descriptive view of Meraki Systems Manager integration with:
  - Identity providers (Azure AD, Okta)
  - Network enforcement (802.1X, RADIUS)
  - API automation
  - SIEM/logging stack

### 3. Workflow Diagrams
- Visuals for enrollment flows, access control decisions, and remediation logic.
- Often built in Lucidchart, draw.io, or Visio.

### 4. Policy Matrix
- Maps device types, user roles, and business units to:
  - Security baselines
  - App catalogs
  - Network entitlements

### 5. Reporting Dashboard Specification
- Defines what compliance, lifecycle, and usage reports are required.
- Links to SIEM, Power BI, or native Meraki dashboards.

### 6. API Playbooks
- API-based scripts (Python, Postman collections, Ansible roles) to automate:
  - Tag assignment
  - Device quarantine
  - License tracking
  - Remote wipe/onboarding

### 7. SLAs and KPIs
- Metrics derived from SOPs (e.g., *‚ÄúDevice onboarding must complete within 15 minutes‚Äù*).
- Used for continuous improvement and platform health reviews.
