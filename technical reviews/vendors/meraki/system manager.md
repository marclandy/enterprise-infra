## üß≠ Overview

Deploying **Meraki Systems Manager (MSM)** at enterprise scale demands a structured, policy-driven design approach. With devices spanning corporate-owned, BYOD, and hybrid models, decisions must be made across multiple layers‚Äîidentity, enrollment, network access, app management, and compliance.

This blog post details critical **design decision areas**, summarizes the choices in a **quick-reference table**, and introduces **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for lifecycle management of devices using Meraki.

## üß∞ Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) ‚Äì Device Lifecycle Management

The following SOPs define the **end-to-end lifecycle** of devices managed by Meraki Systems Manager, from procurement to retirement.

### 1. üîç Device Enrollment

- Leverage automated enrollment via ABM, Zero-Touch, or Windows Autopilot.
- Devices must be tagged by:
  - Ownership (BYOD, COPE, Corp)
  - Business Unit
  - Region
- Devices must check in and receive baseline profiles within 5 minutes.

### 2. üîê Compliance & Policy Enforcement

- Enforce passcode, encryption, jailbreak/root detection.
- Apply role-based access and location-aware restrictions.
- Compliance checks run every 15 minutes.

### 3. üì¶ App Deployment & Patch Management

- All core business apps distributed through VPP/Play Store.
- Auto-update schedule configured weekly (e.g., Sunday midnight).
- App blacklists must be enforced on non-compliant devices.

### 4. üì° Network Access Control

- Device posture evaluated via Sentry before Wi-Fi access.
- RADIUS integration enforces dynamic VLAN and device certificates.

### 5. üìà Monitoring, Logging & Reporting

- Send logs to centralized SIEM (e.g., Splunk) via Syslog.
- Non-compliant devices generate daily digest reports.
- Security incidents escalate via integration with ServiceNow.

### 6. ‚öôÔ∏è Offboarding & Retirement

- De-provisioning triggers remote wipe or enterprise reset.
- Admins must remove licenses and archive logs for 90 days.
- Retired device records deleted after compliance retention period.
