## Executive Summary

### Business Context
- Microsoft ExpressRoute provides private connectivity between on-premises networks and Azure
- MSEE hairpin configurations create specific routing challenges and opportunities
- Strategic infrastructure decision with significant implications for performance, security, and cost

### Key Findings
- Four primary technical approaches identified with distinct tradeoffs
- Performance impact varies from 5-15ms additional latency per hairpin
- Cost implications range from 15-40% premium depending on configuration
- Recommended approach balances performance requirements with operational complexity

## ExpressRoute MSEE Hairpin Fundamentals

### What is MSEE Hairpin?
- Traffic enters an MSEE router through one connection and exits through the same MSEE
- Creates a "U-turn" or "hairpin" configuration in traffic flow
- Often unintended but sometimes a necessary network design pattern
- This default behavior is observed both within a single region (a single circuit with multiple VNet) and across multiple regions (multiple circuits with multiple VNet).

### Common Scenarios Requiring Hairpin
- Multi-region connectivity without full-mesh ExpressRoute circuits
- Transit routing between different networks connected to same circuit
- Connecting environments (prod/non-prod) through a single circuit
- Geographic limitations in ExpressRoute availability
- This common pattern, now deemed outdated involves advertising a summary route for inter-region (i.e. entire Vnet address prefix), adopting a boe-tie design, Common design principles for a hub and spoke, https://github.com/microsoft/Common-Design-Principles-for-a-Hub-and-Spoke-VNET-Archiecture.
