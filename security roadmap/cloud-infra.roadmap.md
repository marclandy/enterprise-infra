## Cloud Infrastructure 

Application - Microservices
App Infra - DB, External Secrets, Namespace
Compute - k8s, Service Mesh, Cluster Resources
Cloud Infra - Projects, IAM, VPC 

Automation
Cloud Infra IaC to streamline  initiatives like the adoption of containers and orchestration.
Platforms & Stream teams need to improve / further mature their IaC capability & move towards a Continuous Delivery-as-a-Service platform across the enterprise (tbc).
Automate software release to production ( across initiatives [a,b,c] ).
Take advantage of automatic task result verification and rollback functionality, facilitating the visibility and certainty of the infra environment creation and deployment processes.
ServiceNow Integration 
Pre & Post deployment steps to update tickets.
Auto-ticketing & approvals functions.
Emerging IaC Tools : Pulumi, OpenTofu, Crossplane to be reviewed twice a year.
IaC Standard / Arch Guardrail to be reviewed annually (assume, Terraform/Ansible are the current standard). 
Check the IaC strategy for workstreams other than Cloud Infra for consistency, i.e. Compute, App Infra and Apps (existing Microservices).

### IDP
Harness Modules
Harness Code Repository
Harness Internal Developer Portal (IDP)
Harness Infrastructure as Code Management (IaCM)
Harness Software Supply Chain Assurance (SSCA)

### IDP Open-Source
Key Differences
Pulumi: Best for developers who prefer using familiar programming languages. Ideal for teams wanting to unify application and infrastructure codebases.
OpenTofu: Offers a simpler, declarative approach using HCL. Best suited for teams with existing Terraform experience and traditional infrastructure workflows.
Crossplane: Perfect for Kubernetes-native environments, focusing on continuous reconciliation and declarative resource management without explicit state files.
