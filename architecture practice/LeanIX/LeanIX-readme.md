## LeanIX Evaluation

# Current State Assessment (CSA)
LeanIX Support: ‚úîÔ∏è Native Support + Customization

Feature: Inventory Management (Application, Technology, Business Capabilities)

How: Use Fact Sheets to document current state across apps, processes, capabilities.

Tooling: Application Landscape, Interface Circle Map, and Lifecycle Diagrams.

Template Help: You can customize LeanIX report views and dashboards to illustrate current vs. future state deltas.

# Target State Architecture (TSA)
LeanIX Support: ‚úîÔ∏è Supported with Modeling + Planning Capabilities

Feature: Future Mode of Operation (FMO) modeling using Architecture Diagrams, Transformation Items, and Project Fact Sheets.

How: Create layers of target architecture using scenarios, planned lifecycle stages, and proposed project links.

Tooling: Roadmaps, Application Landscape future filters, Target Architecture Diagrams.

Template Help: You can use Architecture Decision Templates to capture TSA rationale.

# Options Analysis / Technology Evaluation
LeanIX Support: ‚öôÔ∏è Partially Native, Needs Custom Fields or Reports

Feature: Technology Risk and Lifecycle Views, IT Component Fact Sheets

How: Use Technology Radar and Lifecycle Modeling to assess candidate tech options.

Tooling: Custom scorecards or integrations with ITAM/CMDB/Cost tools may be needed.

Template Help: Architecture decision templates can help document evaluation criteria and decisions.

# Solution Architecture Document (SAD)
LeanIX Support: ‚öôÔ∏è Indirectly Supported ‚Äì Custom Document Composition Required

Feature: Combine Fact Sheets and diagrams across apps, interfaces, services, and domains.

How: Export views into PDF or Word (via Reports or LeanIX API). Use plugins (e.g., Confluence integration) to format into SAD.

Template Help: SAD structure isn‚Äôt directly templated in LeanIX but can be modeled via linked Fact Sheets + Diagrams.

# High-Level Cost Estimates
LeanIX Support: ‚öôÔ∏è Requires External Integration or Custom Fields

Feature: Fact Sheets support cost fields, but not detailed cost modeling.

How: Link to financial management tools (Apptio, ServiceNow, Excel) for cost modeling.

Template Help: You can customize the ‚ÄúProject‚Äù Fact Sheet type to include investment forecasts.

üîó Feature overview: LeanIX Enterprise Architecture Features

# Risk and Dependency Register (Initial)
LeanIX Support: ‚úîÔ∏è Well-Supported

Feature: Dependencies and Risk Fact Sheets

How: Map interdependencies between applications, projects, providers, etc.

Tooling: Risk Tags, Dependency Explorer, and custom reports for impact analysis.

Template Help: Add metadata (e.g., compliance, obsolescence risk) to highlight architectural risks.

# Business Case Input
LeanIX Support: ‚öôÔ∏è Partially Supported, External Tools Recommended

Feature: Use Project Fact Sheets and Lifecycle Overviews to feed into business case models.

How: Export relevant architecture and roadmap insights to support a business case.

Tooling: Best paired with PowerPoint/Word templates, or linked into business case platforms.

Template Help: Can customize project Fact Sheets with business value fields.

Next Steps:
Explore LeanIX ARP demo or trial instance to experiment with these deliverables.

Use Confluence or SharePoint as a wrapper for composing your SADs, TSAs, and CSAs pulling real-time LeanIX data.

Build reusable architecture decision templates using LeanIX‚Äôs sample formats.

üìå Recommendation: Build your own ‚ÄúSAD template‚Äù in Confluence with LeanIX macro embeddings.
