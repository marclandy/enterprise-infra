<details>
<summary>üìå Current State Assessment (CSA)</summary>

**Purpose**: Establish architectural baselines and provide visibility into the as-is landscape.

**LeanIX Capabilities**:
- Application Fact Sheets with lifecycle and health
- Interface Circle Map
- Application Landscape Reports
- Data Flow Visualizer

**LeanIX Usage**:
- Use the Inventory workspace to document applications, technologies, and interfaces.
- Leverage out-of-the-box views (application by business capability, tech category).
- Use surveys to capture business and technical ownership validation.

<details>
<summary>üéØ Target State Architecture (TSA)</summary>

**Purpose**: Communicate desired architecture future state including transformation drivers.

**LeanIX Capabilities**:
- Application/Capability Mapping
- Target Architecture Diagrams
- Transformation Projects module
- Roadmaps (Gantt-style visualizations)

**LeanIX Usage**:
- Use Planning mode to visualize future-state models.
- Create transformation projects to represent initiatives and scope.
- Model application lifecycle states to represent planned transitions.

<details>
<summary>üîç Options Analysis / Technology Evaluation</summary>

**Purpose**: Compare architectural choices (buy vs build, tool X vs Y, integration patterns).

**LeanIX Capabilities**:
- Architecture Decision Templates
- Tech Category Fact Sheets
- Lifecycle Risk reports
- Technology Radar

**LeanIX Usage**:
- Use Architecture Decision Templates for rationale logging.
- Maintain technology lifecycles and risks in Fact Sheets.
- Apply tags to compare and visualize options across capability maps.

<details>
<summary>üìò Solution Architecture Document (SAD)</summary>

**Purpose**: Describe the solution view (business, data, application, and technology layers).

**LeanIX Capabilities**:
- Confluence Plugin for live diagrams
- Application and Data Flow modeling
- Fact Sheet relationships (interfaces, providers, dependencies)
- Reports for automated inclusion into documents

**LeanIX Usage**:
- Build Confluence-native SAD using `/leanix` macros.
- Embed architecture diagrams, lifecycle views, and reference models.
- Keep diagrams live and updated as Fact Sheets evolve.

<details>
<summary>üí∞ High-Level Cost Estimates</summary>

**Purpose**: Provide rough-order-magnitude costs to inform business case feasibility.

**LeanIX Capabilities**:
- Transformation Projects module
- Resource tagging and application tiering
- Integration with cost management tools (e.g., Apptio, ServiceNow)

**LeanIX Usage**:
- Annotate Fact Sheets with tier, criticality, and cost centers.
- Use custom fields for high-level cost metrics.
- Export transformation project portfolio with estimated costs.

</details>

<details>
<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è Risk and Dependency Register (Initial)</summary>

**Purpose**: Record early architecture risks, assumptions, and dependencies.

**LeanIX Capabilities**:
- Surveys and Comments for collaboration
- Dependency Views between Fact Sheets
- Risk Tagging and Lifecycle visibility

**LeanIX Usage**:
- Tag risks per application or integration.
- Use data quality checks to flag missing information.
- Add dependencies to visualize upstream/downstream effects.

</details>

<details>
<summary>üìÇ Business Case Input</summary>

**Purpose**: Supply architecture-led inputs to cost-benefit analysis and value definition.

**LeanIX Capabilities**:
- Business Capability Mapping
- Value Stream Alignment
- Roadmaps tied to Transformation Projects

**LeanIX Usage**:
- Show business alignment using Business Capabilities linked to applications.
- Visualize value contribution with Transformation Initiatives.
- Provide traceability from business outcomes to architecture impacts.
