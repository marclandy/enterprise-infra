| **001** | **EA Practice Charter Adoption** | Network Architects operating in silos<br> → Formal alignment to Enterprise Architecture Practice engagement model<br> → Tailored architecture delivering "Good Architecture" and bridging trust between Business and Technology orgs | <details><summary> <strong> Reminder, use of EA Practice Charter </strong></summary><br>![MJL-Endorsed-Idea-by-industry-EA](https://github.com/marclandy/enterprise-infra/blob/94ba422535f6dee7a982f71972adfa4ef24ffb9c/architecture%20practice/images/mjl-net%20arch%20contribution%20to%20arch%20practice%20governance.PNG)</details> | Implemented | **EA Community Endorsed** |
| **002** | **Integrated EA Models Framework** | Network/Infrastructure architects disconnected from business context<br> → **[Integrated thinking approach](https://medium.com/@marclandy.me/network-infrastructure-contribution-to-architecture-practice-e18a3271ac20)** leveraging all four EA models (Business, Capability, Operating, VCCE)<br> → Greater ARB approval success rate and measurable business impact | <details><summary> <strong> Integrated thinking re: EA Models </strong></summary><br>![MJL-Endorsed-Idea-by-industry-EA](https://github.com/marclandy/enterprise-infra/blob/055bbbe19b983875f149a9e83f0a62b27901547d/architecture%20practice/images/mjl-net%20arch-what%20is%20a%20capability%20map%20and%20why%20does%20the%20business%20need%20it.PNG)</details> | Active | **EA Community Endorsed** |
| **003** | **LeanIX Strategic Engagement** | Manual architecture documentation creating delivery delays<br> → Leveraging LeanIX platform to streamline strategy and project engagement processes<br> → Accelerated deliverable creation and improved stakeholder alignment | **[LeanIX Implementation Guide](link)** | Planning Phase | Tool Vendor Validated |
| **004** | **IT Work Classification Framework** | IT stakeholders struggling with project prioritization and next-steps<br> → **Work type Methodology: from "Phoenix Project"** categorizing all work (Business Projects, Internal Projects, Operational Change, Unplanned Work)<br> → Simplified decision-making and faster requirement resolution | **[4 Types of Work In IT Framework](https://github.com/marclandy/enterprise-infra/blob/ml-port/architecture%20practice/images/Phoenix%20Project.png)** | Implemented | DevOps Community Standard |
| **005** | **Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) Framework** | Complex infrastructure projects (prisons/justice facilities) with siloed governance between building authorities and end-user departments <br>→ Strategic TPRM framework integrating cross-organizational accountability and technical requirement alignment <br>→ Taxpayer cost avoidance (millions), reduced project delivery risk, enhanced security compliance for critical facilities | **[TPRM Framework](https://github.com/marclandy/enterprise-infra/blob/ml-port/architecture%20practice/images/TPRM.jpg)** | Implementation Phase | NIST/ISO 27001 Aligned |
