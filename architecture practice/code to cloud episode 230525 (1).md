Objective i) **Simplification of the ALZ Deployment Process (The What & Why)**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Process Name | Process Details |
| --- | --- |
| ALZ Terraform Accelerator Overview (4:10–10:25) | Overview of the ALZ Terraform Accelerator built on Azure Verified Modules (AVM); introduces modularization, scalability, and ease of integration into CI/CD pipelines. |
| Planning Your Deployment (10:25–17:00) | Covers how modular AVM enables planning across different environments; emphasizes flexibility in defining platform landing zones (CAF-aligned). |
| Deployment Scenarios Explained (17:00–23:00) | Compares common enterprise scenarios (hub/spoke, enterprise-scale landing zones); illustrates how the accelerator simplifies architecture selection and reusability. |
| Summary & Closing (02:03:30–02:15:05) | Recaps the streamlined workflow, GitOps-friendly patterns, and alignment with platform engineering principles. |

Objective ii) **Technical ALZ Bootstrap Deployment (The How)**
------------------------------------------------------------------

| Bootstrap Step | Bootstrap Step Details |
| --- | --- |
| Deploying Bootstrap Resources (23:00–38:30) | Walkthrough of provisioning core resources (management group hierarchy, log analytics, key vault, storage, etc.) using pre-built modules. |
| Configuring the Bootstrap Accelerator (38:30–43:55) | Explanation of how to parameterize the bootstrap via input files; linking to pre-defined AVM-compliant modules for consistency and version control. |
| Setting Up GitHub Integration (43:55–45:00) | Enables GitOps through integration with GitHub repositories; discusses branching, workflows, and pipelines required. |
| Configuring PAT Tokens (45:00–50:00) | Details setup of Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for GitHub Actions authentication and secure CI/CD interaction. |
| Inputs YAML Configuration Guide (50:00–1:03:25) | In-depth review of YAML structure to define bootstrap configurations: management groups, policies, etc. |
| TFVARS Configuration Walkthrough (1:03:25–1:15:00) | Discusses the use of `terraform.tfvars` to dynamically feed variables into the deployment engine. |
| Final Variable Configuration (1:15:00–1:16:00) | Final checks and parameter values to ensure end-to-end config consistency before deployment. |
| Deploying Bootstrap Resources (again) (1:16:00–1:30:00) | Execution of bootstrap process using GitHub Actions, validating outputs and logs. |
| Deploying the ALZ Platform (1:30:00–2:03:30) | Full deployment of ALZ core platform using AVM modules, including policy assignments, connectivity patterns, identity, and security resources. |
