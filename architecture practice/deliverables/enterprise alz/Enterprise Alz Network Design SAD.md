## 2. Purpose and Intent

This document outlines the **networking architecture and design considerations** for an Enterprise Azure Landing Zone (ALZ), aligned with Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF). It serves as a strategic guide and technical design skeleton to:

- Define networking services, guardrails, and control planes foundational to a scalable ALZ.
- Serve as a design input for vendor-authored HLDs.
- Enable the creation of reusable Terraform modules and patterns for continuous delivery.
- Provide a common understanding for internal stakeholders, cloud CoEs, and delivery partners.

> *Target use case: Australian Federal Government agencies (e.g., NDIA), or mid-tier Utility, Retail, or Transport/Logistics orgs using MSPs/PS partners with minimal internal cloud capability.*

## 3. Key Assumptions

| Assumption Area      | Assumption                                                                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloud Adoption       | Organization is in early ALZ deployment or re-architecture phase.           |
| Vendor Engagement    | Professional services or MSP-led implementation model.                      |
| Infrastructure Stack | Hybrid connectivity (ExpressRoute/Site-to-Site VPN), use of SD-WAN.         |
| Networking Platform  | Azure-native networking constructs preferred (vNets, NSGs, Azure Firewall). |
| Security             | Policy-as-Code, RBAC, and Zero Trust principles being adopted.              |
| IaC Delivery         | Terraform-based ALZ deployment pipelines with modular design.               |
| Org Structure        | Lean internal tech team; heavy reliance on vendor deliverables.             |

## 4. Network Architecture Overview

### 4.1 Hub & Spoke Topology

- Centralised **Hub vNet** per region.
- Contains shared services: DNS, Bastion, Jump Host, NGFW (Palo Alto, Azure Firewall).
- Spokes per environment (Dev/Test/Prod), per business unit, per workload category.

### 4.2 Hybrid Connectivity

- ER Gateway for data centre interconnect.
- VPN Gateway for branch/remote site failover.
- SD-WAN integration (Meraki/Juniper) at branch to ER edge.

### 4.3 Segmentation Strategy

- Environment-based segmentation (Non-Prod vs Prod).
- Zoning for control, management, and workload planes.
- Tag-driven enforcement and firewall policies via Azure Policy + initiative sets.

## 5. Network Service Patterns & Design Decisions

| Network Service     | Design Pattern / Decision Point                           | Justification                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| DNS                 | Private DNS Zones with conditional forwarders             | Centralized control, supports hybrid resolution |
| Firewall            | Azure Firewall or 3rd party NGFW (Palo/CheckPoint)        | Deep inspection, logging, segmentation          |
| Bastion / Jump Host | Deployed in Hub only, integrated with Just-in-Time access | Least-privilege, audit-ready access model       |
| NSGs                | Layered with UDRs, enforced via ALZ Policies              | Tier-based zoning enforcement                   |
| DDoS Protection     | Azure DDoS Standard enabled at vNet level                 | Protects public endpoints                       |
| Routing             | Central UDR tables, route-server model optional           | Consistent traffic control                      |

## 6. Governance, RBAC & Policy Considerations

### 6.1 Role Separation Model

- **Cloud Network Admin**: vNet, VPN, ER, NSG, Route Table, FW, LB
- **Platform Team**: Deploy shared services via pipelines
- **App Team**: Scoped subnet access only
- **Security Team**: Read/Alert access, policy authoring

### 6.2 AzAdvertizer-Based Least-Privilege RBAC

- Reference: [https://azadvertizer.net](https://azadvertizer.net)
- Used to define exact permission sets per Azure Networking resource (e.g., `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/join/action`)

### 6.3 Azure Policy & Initiative Alignment

- Policy-as-Code with Terraform/PolicySet integration
- Deny public IPs, enforce UDRs, enforce private endpoints, subnet sizing, tagging schema enforcement

## 7. Integration Points & Dependencies

| Dependency                   | Description                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Identity & Access Management | Azure AD, PIM, Conditional Access integration  |
| Logging & Monitoring         | Azure Monitor, Network Watcher, Log Analytics  |
| DevOps Tooling               | Terraform pipelines (Azure DevOps/GitHub)      |
| Security                     | NGFW integration, Sentinel, Defender for Cloud |

## 8. Risks, Constraints, Open Issues

| Category     | Description                                       | Mitigation Strategy                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Skills Gap   | Internal team has limited cloud network expertise | Provide design skeletons, enable vendor handover  |
| Policy Drift | Changes made outside IaC pipeline                 | Enforce management group-level locks, audit logs  |
| Hybrid Conf  | Legacy MPLS/OT overlaps in IP space               | Conduct IPAM planning, DNS split-horizon strategy |

---

## 9. Next Steps

- Finalise network HLD inputs
- Review Terraform module patterns for network RBAC
- Align with security team on segmentation principles
- Prepare vendor onboarding package (design input briefs)

## 10. Appendices

- Appendix A: RBAC Matrix for Azure Networking Services
- Appendix B: ALZ Terraform Module Structure (Network Only)
- Appendix C: Azure Policy Samples (Network Guardrails)
- Appendix D: ExpressRoute/SD-WAN Design Option Analysis

Here's your **templated Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) Network Design - Solution Architecture Document (SAD)** skeleton, tailored to your background and likely customer profile (e.g., NDIA, mid-tier utility, retailer, or logistics org). It incorporates intention, assumptions, governance, policy-as-code, and IaC alignment â€” providing a strong foundation for vendor handover and design discussions.

You can now iterate on this document to include customer-specific details or generate supporting artifacts like Terraform RBAC modules or detailed HLDs. Let me know when you're ready to build out any appendices or automate part of this.
