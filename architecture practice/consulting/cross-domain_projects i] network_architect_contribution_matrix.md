<summary> <strong> Key Network Architecture Principles Across All Projects: </strong></summary>
  
| Principles | Description | 
|------------|-------------|
| **Security-First Design:** | Every project should incorporate network security controls from the ground up, not as an afterthought. |
| **Scalability Planning:** | Design network solutions that can grow with business needs and handle projected traffic volumes. |
| **Resilience & Redundancy:** | Ensure network designs include appropriate failover mechanisms and eliminate single points of failure. |
| **Performance Optimization:** | Consider latency, bandwidth, and QoS requirements specific to each application or service. |
| **Operational Excellence:** | Design networks that are monitorable, manageable, and supportable by operations teams. |
| **Standards Compliance:** | Ensure all network designs align with enterprise architecture standards and regulatory requirements. |
