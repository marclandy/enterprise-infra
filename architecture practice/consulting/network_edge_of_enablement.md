# Network: At the Edge of Enablement

> *My capability often sits at the edge of domains, where security, access, and enablement collide.*

## Marc Landy â€“ Network Architect

**Overarching Objective:**<br>		
&nbsp;&nbsp; â–« I use the power of [ synthesizing Enterprise Architecture models ](https://medium.com/@marclandy.me/list/architecture-practice-35fbc170845d) to bridge an organisations business strategy with technical execution to ensure cost centers are viewed as digital strategic enablers.<br>

**Purpose:**<br>						
&nbsp;&nbsp; â–« This charter defines the architectural value and strategic capability that Network [ *delivers* ]( https://github.com/marclandy/enterprise-infra/blob/ad172fe11097bcc45e696931ea4f33cd7dc34554/architecture%20practice/consulting/net-arch-capability-dashboard.md ) within complex enterprise programs, particularly across large-scale, regulated, and hybrid environments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; â–« Today, I am eager to leverage my comprehensive experience in a full-time role and be accountable for developing a multi-year roadmap & delivering key components<br>                                                               &nbsp;&nbsp; â–« Secondly, to further develop & provide full coverage across the Infrastructure domain (as per the breakdown below)<br>

**Architecture Mandate:**<br>			
â–« ***Deliver*** business value through solutions that integrate People, Process and Technology, ensuring fit-for-purpose outcomes across the enterprise.<br>
â–« ***Balance*** local decision-making with global alignment, contributing to federated enterprise models where autonomy and consistency must coexist.<br>
â–« ***Produce*** high-quality architecture artefacts on time, supporting effective delivery and stakeholder confidence through the project lifecycle.<br>

## Why This Matters

â–« Network Architecture is no longer confined to cabling and uptime.<br> 
â–« I operate at a critical junction, **where digital enablement meets enterprise control**.<br> 

*My work enables*:
- **Secure, performant access** to cloud, apps, and data.
- **Operational resilience** across distributed and remote environments.
- **Transformation programs** like M&A, hybrid cloud, and IT/OT convergence.
- **Policy enforcement** at the network level in support of Zero Trust.
- **Technology lifecycle stewardship** to avoid risk and cost blowout.
- **Harnessing emerging technology** to create market differentiation and digital advantage.

## Where I Sit in the Technology Landscape / Stack

*Work closely with the stakeholders below & my governance contribution to shared outcomes*

- **Security Architects :** to enforce trust zones, SSE, microsegmentation
- **Cloud & Platform Architects :** to land workloads securely and predictably
- **Data & Application Architects :** to ensure data flows and latency profiles are respected
- **IAM Architects :** to support device identity, network-based access, and certificate services
- **OT Engineers :** to bridge traditionally isolated plant networks with modern IT capabilities
