# Network: At the Edge of Enablement

> “My capability often sits at the edge of domains, where security, access, and enablement collide.”

## Marc Landy – Enterprise Network Architect

**Overarching Objective:**<br>		
&nbsp;&nbsp; ▫ I use the power of [ synthesizing Enterprise Architecture models ](https://medium.com/@marclandy.me/list/architecture-practice-35fbc170845d) to bridge an organisations business strategy with technical execution to ensure cost centers are viewed as digital strategic enablers.<br>

**Purpose:**<br>						
&nbsp;&nbsp; ▫ This charter defines the architectural value and strategic capability that Network [ *delivers* ]( https://github.com/marclandy/enterprise-infra/blob/cc569da1f34197d25de3acfd46dcbd451cf79a5c/architecture%20practice/consulting/net-arch-capability-dashboard.md ) within complex enterprise programs, particularly across large-scale, regulated, and hybrid environments.<br>

**Architecture Mandate:**<br>			
▫ ***Deliver*** business value through solutions that integrate People, Process and Technology, ensuring fit-for-purpose outcomes across the enterprise.<br>
▫ ***Balance*** local decision-making with global alignment, contributing to federated enterprise models where autonomy and consistency must coexist.<br>
▫ ***Produce*** high-quality architecture artefacts on time, supporting effective delivery and stakeholder confidence through the project lifecycle.<br>

## Why This Matters

▫ Network Architecture is no longer confined to cabling and uptime.<br> 
▫ I operate at a critical junction, **where digital enablement meets enterprise control**.<br> 

My work enables:
- **Secure, performant access** to cloud, apps, and data.
- **Operational resilience** across distributed and remote environments.
- **Transformation programs** like M&A, hybrid cloud, and IT/OT convergence.
- **Policy enforcement** at the network level in support of Zero Trust.
- **Technology lifecycle stewardship** to avoid risk and cost blowout.
- **Harnessing emerging technology** to create market differentiation and digital advantage.

## Where I Sit in the Architecture Stack

<details>
<summary><strong> Work closely with, </strong></summary>

- *Security Architects:* to enforce trust zones, SSE, microsegmentation
- *Cloud & Platform Architects:* to land workloads securely and predictably
- *Data & Application Architects:* to ensure data flows and latency profiles are respected
- *IAM Architects:* to support device identity, network-based access, and certificate services
- *OT Engineers:* to bridge traditionally isolated plant networks with modern IT capabilities
