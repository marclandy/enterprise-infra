# Network: At the Edge of Enablement

> “My capability often sits at the edge of domainsm, where security, access, and enablement collide.”

## Marc Landy – Enterprise Network Architect

*Overarching objective:*
- I use the power of synthesizing Enterprise Architecture models to bridge an organisations business strategy with technical execution to ensure cost centers are viewed as digital strategic enablers.

## Purpose  
This charter defines the architectural value and strategic capability that Network delivers within complex enterprise programs, 
particularly across large-scale, regulated, and hybrid environments.

## Architecture Mandate
- *Deliver* business value through solutions that integrate People, Process and Technology, ensuring fit-for-purpose outcomes across the enterprise.
- *Balance* local decision-making with global alignment, contributing to federated enterprise models where autonomy and consistency must coexist.
- *Produce* high-quality architecture artefacts on time, supporting effective delivery and stakeholder confidence through the project lifecycle.

## Why This Matters

Network Architecture is no longer confined to cabling and uptime. I operate at a critical junction, **where digital enablement meets enterprise control**. My work enables:

- **Secure, performant access** to cloud, apps, and data.
- **Operational resilience** across distributed and remote environments.
- **Transformation programs** like M&A, hybrid cloud, and IT/OT convergence.
- **Policy enforcement** at the network level in support of Zero Trust.
- **Technology lifecycle stewardship** to avoid risk and cost blowout.
- **Harnessing emerging technology** to create market differentiation and digital advantage.

## Where I Sit in the Architecture Stack

Work closely with:
- Security Architects: to enforce trust zones, SSE, microsegmentation
- Cloud & Platform Architects: to land workloads securely and predictably
- Data & Application Architects: to ensure data flows and latency profiles are respected
- IAM Architects: to support device identity, network-based access, and certificate services
- OT Engineers: to bridge traditionally isolated plant networks with modern IT capabilities
