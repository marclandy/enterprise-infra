# SSE Customer Requirements Catalog

*A Solution Architecture View for Modern Enterprise Security*

Security modernization in the cloud-first era demands more than VPN replacements and isolated controls. Enterprises are moving toward **Security Service Edge (SSE)**, a unified framework that secures access to the internet, cloud apps, and private applications, wherever users are located.

This post presents a **SSE Customer Requirements Catalog**, suitable for inclusion in a **Solution Architecture Document (SAD)**. It translates SSE capabilities into architecture-driven requirements designed to support real-world deployment, integration, and scale.

### Architectural Objective

**To implement a scalable, zero-trust-aligned Security Service Edge (SSE) solution** that consolidates threat protection, data security, and secure access into a cloud-native service, integrated into the enterprise architecture stack.

We assume:

- Netskope is the selected SSE vendor.
- Integration with Cisco SD-WAN, existing identity providers (e.g., Azure AD), SIEM/SOAR tooling, and endpoint platforms.
- A ZTNA approach that **replaces legacy VPN models** with granular, identity- and context-aware access controls.

## SSE Capability Domains

## Architecture Implications

- **Zero Trust Enablement:** Supports a many-to-many architecture where users connect to apps---not networks.
- **VPN Replacement:** Combined SWG, CASB, and ZTNA eliminate the need for traditional VPN infrastructure.
- **Unified Policy Engine:** One console to govern policies across users, devices, locations, and app types.
- **SecOps Synergy:** Analytics and open APIs enable threat intelligence sharing, incident enrichment, and response automation.

## Final Thoughts

The SSE Customer Requirements Catalog is more than a list of features, it's a **security design blueprint**. It helps technology teams:

- Align product selection with Zero Trust and SSE principles.
- Translate architecture decisions into actionable controls.
- Communicate functional and non-functional needs in procurement and implementation.

As enterprise security evolves, your **SSE platform should act as a strategic enabler**, not just a tactical replacement. Netskope's cloud-native, API-first, and risk-adaptive architecture positions it strongly for organizations looking to standardize SSE across global users and applications.
