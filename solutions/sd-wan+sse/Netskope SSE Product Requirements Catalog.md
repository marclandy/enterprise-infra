# Netskope SSE Product Requirements Catalog  
*A Solution Architecture View for Modern Enterprise Security*

Security modernization in the cloud-first era demands more than **VPN replacements** and isolated controls. Enterprises are moving toward **Security Service Edge (SSE)**â€”a unified framework that secures access to the internet, cloud apps, and private applications, wherever users are located.

This catalog is suitable for inclusion in a Solution Architecture Document (SAD). It translates SSE capabilities into architecture-driven requirements designed to support real-world deployment, integration, and scale.

Note: The VPN Replacement project is often a common use-case to faciliate the driver for beginning a SSE journey.
