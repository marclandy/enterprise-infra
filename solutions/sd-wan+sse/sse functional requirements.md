## Key Recommendations

1. **Prioritize AI Security**: Requirements with "-AI" suffix represent the most current and critical security needs for Generative AI protection
2. **Unified Architecture**: Ensure all components integrate seamlessly for consistent policy enforcement
3. **Contextual Intelligence**: Leverage identity, device, location, and behavioral context across all components
4. **Continuous Verification**: Implement Zero Trust principles with ongoing validation rather than one-time authentication
5. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Involve legal, HR, and data officers in requirement validation and policy development
