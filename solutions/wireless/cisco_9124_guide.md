# Cisco 9124 Antenna Guide

## Overview

Cisco has released the external 9124 variant access point, featuring a powerful three-radio configuration designed for demanding outdoor environments. This AP includes one 2.4GHz radio and dual 5GHz radios, making it particularly well-suited for mesh deployments where you can maintain a dedicated 5GHz backhaul while serving clients on a separate 5GHz radio.

## Key Features

### Radio Configuration
- **1x 2.4GHz radio**
- **2x 5GHz radios** (dual 5GHz capability)

### Primary Use Cases
- **Mesh Networks**: Dedicated 5GHz backhaul with separate client-serving 5GHz radio
- **External Wi-Fi**: Industrial-grade design built for harsh environmental conditions
- **High-Performance Coverage**: Multiple antenna configurations for various deployment scenarios

## Antenna Architecture

### Port Layout
The Cisco 9124 features **6 antenna ports** with the following configuration:

#### Dual-Band Ports (1-4)
- **Lower ports 1 & 2**: Support 2.4GHz, 5GHz, or mixed operation
- **Upper ports 3 & 4**: Support 2.4GHz, 5GHz, or mixed operation

#### Dedicated 5GHz Ports (5-6)
- **Upper ports 5 & 6**: 5GHz-only antennas

### Critical Antenna Requirements

> **Important**: Unlike earlier Cisco APs, the 9124 has specific antenna installation requirements that affect band operation.

#### Minimum Antenna Requirements
- **2 antennas only** (ports 1-2): **2.4GHz operation only**
- **4+ antennas** (ports 1-4): **Dual-band operation enabled**
- **6 antennas** (all ports): **Maximum performance capability**

## Installation Options

### Omnidirectional Setup
**Recommended Antenna**: Cisco AIR-ANT2547VG-N

Configuration using 4 dual-band omnidirectional antennas:
- Ports 1-4: Dual-band antennas supporting both 2.4GHz and 5GHz
- Ports 5-6: Optional 5GHz-only antennas for enhanced performance

### Directional Setup
**Patch Antenna Configuration**:
- Use 3 patch antennas across the three radios
- **Important**: Avoid using the third port on only two antennas

## Performance Specifications

### Stream Capabilities

| Antenna Count | Stream Configuration |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 2 antennas    | 1x1 MIMO           |
| 4 antennas    | 2x2 or 4x4 MIMO    |
| 6 antennas    | Up to 8x8 MIMO     |

> **Performance Note**: Maximum throughput requires all antennas to be installed and properly configured.

## Power Requirements

### Power Options and Capabilities

| Power Source | Capability | Configuration |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **30W (802.3at)** | Limited Operation | 2x2 streams on 4 main antennas<br>Two radios only (1x 2.4GHz + 1x 5GHz) |
| **60W (802.3bt/UPOE)** | Full Operation | 4x4 streams (antennas 1-4)<br>2x2 streams (antennas 5-6)<br>All three radios active |

### Power Recommendation
> **Best Practice**: Install 60W power from the outset to avoid performance limitations and enable full AP capabilities.

## Detailed Antenna Configuration Matrix

| Power | Streams | Band | Ant 1 | Ant 2 | Ant 3 | Ant 4 | Ant 5 | Ant 6 |
|-------|---------|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 30W   | 2x2     | 2.4  | ✓     | ✓     |       |       |       |       |
|       | 2x2     | 5    |       |       | ✓     | ✓     |       |       |
| 60W   | 4x4     | 2.4  | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     |       |       |
|       | 4x4     | 5    | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     |       |       |
| 60W   | 4x4     | 2.4  | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     |       |       |
|       | 4x4     | 5    | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     | ✓     |       |       |
|       | 2x2     | 5    |       |       |       |       | ✓     | ✓     |

*Note: The AP also supports 1x1 mode (not shown in table above), presumably with only two antennas.*

## Design Considerations

### Environmental Suitability
- **Industrial-grade construction** for external installations
- **Weather-resistant design** suitable for various climatic conditions
- **High-temperature operation** capability for demanding environments

### Mesh Network Complexity
The dual 5GHz radio configuration makes this AP ideal for mesh deployments, but design complexity increases significantly when implementing mesh topologies. Careful planning is required for optimal mesh performance.

## Summary
