# Federated Orchestration for Global Multi-Cloud Networking (MCN)

**Service Architecture Pattern Document**

## 1. Executive Summary

The following Service Architecture Pattern outlines a future-ready model for enabling federated orchestration across global connectivity providers, cloud platforms, enterprise WANs, and security fabrics. It is designed to support large enterprises undergoing digital and data transformation, particularly those with globally distributed operations, M&A activity, and a mix of IT/OT workloads. The pattern emphasizes software-defined, API-driven service composition and delivery, integrating traditional telco capabilities (e.g., BT, Orange) with interconnect specialists (e.g., Equinix, Megaport) and cloud-native service fabric providers (e.g., Cato, Zscaler, Coevolve).

## 2. Business Drivers

- Accelerated cloud and SaaS adoption across business units
- Increasing reliance on third-party partners and managed service providers
- Demand for just-in-time onboarding of new sites due to M&A
- Security posture shift towards Zero Trust and least-privileged access
- Operational efficiency and automation at the global WAN edge

## 3. Strategic Goals

- Enable dynamic provisioning of end-to-end services across regions and providers
- Centralize visibility, policy enforcement, and identity-driven access
- Abstract complexity of underlay telco infrastructure
- Federate orchestration responsibilities across domains and teams
- Provide a single operating model for global connectivity and access

## 4. Key Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Responsibility |
|-------------|----------------|
| Enterprise Network Team | Design and manage WAN, interconnects, and SD-WAN overlays |
| Security Architects | Define Zero Trust, SSE, and identity federation models |
| Cloud Platform Teams | Manage CSP landing zones, VNets/VPCs, cloud routers |
| Service Providers (e.g., BT, Orange) | Provision physical circuits and managed CPEs |
| Interconnect Providers (e.g., Equinix, Megaport) | Enable on-demand IX/CX capacity |
| Managed SASE/MSP Partners (e.g., Coevolve) | Integrate and orchestrate end-to-end service across components |

## 5. Core Services & Capabilities

- **Connectivity-as-a-Service (CaaS)**: Consumption-based transport capacity delivered via IX/CX APIs
- **SD-WAN Overlay Fabric**: Application-aware routing and failover
- **SASE/SSE Integration**: Inline security (SWG, CASB, DLP, ZTNA)
- **Cloud Interconnect**: Direct peering with hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Federated Orchestration Layer**: Policy engine, telemetry, and API coordination across domains
- **ZTNA for B2B/3rd Party Access**: Role- and risk-based access control with full audit visibility

## 6. Logical Architecture Overview

```
+---------------------------+     +---------------------------+
| Enterprise Edge Sites     |<--->| SD-WAN / SASE Fabric     |
| (Factories, HQ, Branches) |     | (Cato, Zscaler, Prisma)  |
+---------------------------+     +---------------------------+
             |                                 |
             v                                 v
+---------------------------+     +---------------------------+

                                  +---------------------------+
```

## 7. Operating Model Options

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Fully Managed** | External partner handles orchestration, support, SLAs |
| **Co-Managed** | Enterprise manages policies; partner operates network fabric |
| **Self-Managed + Orchestration-as-a-Service** | Internal team runs stack with external orchestration support |

## 8. Use Cases

- **M&A Onboarding**: Rapid integration of acquired entities into existing cloud and WAN environments
- **Remote OT & SCADA Access**: Secure and optimized paths for telemetry and control systems
- **Third-Party Collaboration**: Conditional access for vendors and service partners using ZTNA
- **Multi-Cloud Peering**: Seamless transport across CSP tenants for distributed workloads
- **SaaS Acceleration**: Performance optimization for Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Zoom, etc.

## 9. Recommendations for Next Steps

1. Map existing provider and platform relationships (Telco, IX/CX, Cloud)
2. Identify orchestration silos (network, cloud, security, identity)
3. Conduct a PoC with a provider like Coevolve or Expereo
4. Develop a Federated Service Catalog and standard API interface set
5. Establish governance around SLA, security policy, and identity roles across domains

## Conclusion: Your Federated Orchestrator Proposal Makes Sense

This model acknowledges the policy-plane convergence achieved by companies like Cato—consolidating SD-WAN, SSE, and ZTNA into a unified, managed service. However, enterprise-scale needs such as industrial M&A, remote OT control, and global SaaS optimization demand deeper orchestration across IX fabrics, CSP edge presence, and telco underlay coordination. Independent players like Coevolve have the neutrality and flexibility to deliver this model at scale—especially when combined with infrastructure players like Equinix or Megaport.

Your proposal enables enterprises to abstract service delivery complexity, automate site-to-cloud-to-partner provisioning, and bring network, security, and cloud stakeholders under a federated operating envelope. This isn't a reinvention of SD-WAN—it's the logical next phase: dynamic, intent-driven, and API-first connectivity that behaves more like DevOps pipelines than legacy WAN provisioning workflows.

## Appendix A: The Opportunity — Full-Scope MCN Orchestration

While existing solutions provide integrated overlays and security controls, most do not orchestrate the full physical and logical path: from enterprise edge to CSP tenant, through IX/CX fabrics and cloud routers, to SaaS front doors or data pipelines.

This federated model highlights a clear opportunity:

- Stitching connectivity services across providers
- Providing secure, policy-based remote access
- Dynamically brokering underlay and overlay capacity

This is especially vital for enterprises undergoing rapid expansion, M&A, or OT/IT convergence.

### Use Cases for Industrial Customers

- **Oil & Gas**: Federated orchestration to onboard remote rigs to cloud-based SCADA
- **Mining**: Secure ZTNA access for remote contractors during exploration
- **Manufacturing**: Connecting new production lines during global joint ventures

### What Comes Next: Where Coevolve-Type Models Expand

- Integrating public IX/CX (e.g., Megaport) with private cloud underlays
- Enabling service chaining across independent orchestration stacks
- Providing API governance for security domains, telemetry, and SLA metrics

                          +-------------+
